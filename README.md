# Minecraft DeathLocation
I'm sure you already have had that problem. You died, lost your items, but you can't remember exactly where you died and your items will be lost.
This plugin helps you with that.
If you (or any other player on your server) dies, the location will be displayed in the chat / actionbar / title.

## Features
- Displays the location in the chat (It's also possible to append the location to the existing death message).
- Displays the location in the ActionBar.
- Displays the location as title.
- The death message is customizable.
- The message with the death location can be broadcast to all players on the server.
