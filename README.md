# Minecraft DeathLocation
I'm sure you already have had that problem. You died, lost your items, but you can't remember exactly where you died and your items will be lost.
This plugin helps you with that.
If you (or any other player on your server) dies, the location will be displayed in the chat / actionbar / title.
